A **page fault** is an event that occurs when a running program tries to access a portion of memory that is **not currently mapped to physical RAM**. It‚Äôs a normal and expected part of memory management in modern operating systems that use **virtual memory**.

---

### üîç **What is a Page Fault?**

When a process accesses a **virtual address**, the CPU checks the **page table** to see if the corresponding **page is in RAM**.

- If the page **is in RAM**, the access proceeds normally. ‚úÖ
    
- If the page **is not in RAM**, a **page fault** occurs. üö®
    

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è **Types of Page Faults**

1. **Minor (Soft) Page Fault**:
    
    - The page is not in the current process's memory, but **it is in RAM**, possibly in another process's memory or in the OS‚Äôs cache.
        
    - No disk access is required.
        
    - Resolved quickly.
        
2. **Major (Hard) Page Fault**:
    
    - The page is **not in RAM at all**, and the OS must **load it from disk** (e.g., swap space or memory-mapped file).
        
    - Involves **I/O**, so it‚Äôs **much slower**.
        
    - Can degrade performance if frequent.
        
3. **Invalid Page Fault**:
    
    - The access is to an **illegal memory address** (e.g., null pointer or freed memory).
        
    - Usually causes the OS to **terminate the process** (e.g., segmentation fault).
        

---

### üìà Example (Linux/Unix)

You can check the number of page faults a process causes using:

bash

`ps -o min_flt,maj_flt -p <pid>`

Or with `vmstat`:

bash

`vmstat 1`

---

### üß† Why Page Faults Exist

Page faults are **not necessarily bad**. They allow:

- Efficient use of physical RAM.
    
- Running programs that are larger than available RAM.
    
- Demand paging (load only needed parts of programs).
    

---

### üßÆ Analogy

Think of virtual memory as a **library index**:

- Your program asks for a book (page).
    
- If it's on the desk (RAM), you hand it over immediately (no fault).
    
- If it‚Äôs on the bookshelf (disk), you walk over and fetch it (page fault).
    
- If it‚Äôs not in the library (invalid), you throw an error.

### ‚úÖ **Why can a _soft page fault_ happen?**

A **soft page fault** can happen **when the page is in memory but not currently accessible by the process**, typically due to:

#### 1. **Shared memory pages**

- The OS may keep shared pages (e.g., shared libraries) in memory and map them lazily into processes only when accessed.
    
- The first time a process tries to access that page, a soft fault occurs and the OS maps it in.
    

#### 2. **Copy-on-Write (COW)**

- When a process is forked (e.g., with `fork()`), both parent and child initially **share the same memory pages**, marked as read-only.
    
- When one of them writes to a shared page, a soft page fault occurs, and the OS makes a **private copy** of that page.
    
- This triggers a soft fault, but the page is already in RAM.
    

#### 3. **Swapped-in but still unmapped**

- A page that was previously swapped out to disk may already be **brought back into memory** by another process (in case of shared memory), but not yet mapped into this process.
    
- Accessing it causes a soft fault.
    

#### 4. **Memory-mapped files**

- When a file is memory-mapped (via `mmap()`), the actual mapping may be deferred until the memory is accessed.
    
- The file's contents are likely already in the OS file cache (RAM), so accessing it causes a soft page fault.

### üß† Summary

> A **soft page fault** occurs when the memory page a process wants **is already in RAM**, but **not yet mapped into the process‚Äôs virtual memory**. The OS can resolve it without accessing disk, making it _faster than a hard fault_.




when one fork happen, the parent and the children use the same shared memory?

###### ChatGPT said:

Yes ‚Äî **initially**, after a `fork()`, the **parent and child share the same physical memory pages** ‚Äî but **with a special trick**: **Copy-on-Write (COW)**.

---

### üîÅ What happens on `fork()`:

When a process calls `fork()`:

- The child gets a **copy of the parent's page table**, but:
    
- **Both parent and child point to the same physical memory pages.**
    
- All pages are marked **read-only**, even if they were writable before.
    

This saves memory and improves performance ‚Äî **no physical memory is copied yet**.

---

### üß† How Copy-On-Write works:

If either process (parent or child) tries to **write** to a shared page:

1. A **soft page fault** occurs (because the page is marked read-only).
    
2. The OS handles the fault by:
    
    - Allocating a **new page in RAM**.
        
    - **Copying** the content from the original shared page.
        
    - Updating that process‚Äôs page table to point to the **new private page** (now writable).
        
3. The other process still uses the **original page**.
    

This allows:

- Fast process creation.
    
- Efficient memory usage (until writes happen).
    

---

### üìå Summary:

- After `fork()`, **yes**, parent and child **share the same physical memory**.
    
- But it's a **read-only shared memory**.
    
- **Copy-on-Write** ensures real copying happens **only when needed (on write access)**.
    

Would you like a diagram or simple C example to visualize this?

##### You said:

if the parent and children process will disapart run? they still use the same memory?

###### ChatGPT said:

Great follow-up! Here's a clear answer:

---

### üß† After `fork()`, do the parent and child processes run independently?

**Yes.**  
After a `fork()`, the **parent and child are separate processes** with:

- Their **own process IDs (PIDs)**.
    
- Their **own virtual memory spaces**.
    
- Their **own program counters**, stacks, etc.
    

They **run independently**, and the OS scheduler decides when each runs.

---

### üíæ Do they still use the same memory?

#### ‚úÖ **At first ‚Äî Yes (shared with Copy-on-Write)**

- Right after `fork()`, the child **shares the same physical memory pages** as the parent.
    
- These pages are **read-only** and shared to save memory.
    
- This is the **Copy-on-Write (COW)** mechanism.
    

#### ‚ùå **Later ‚Äî No (when writing occurs)**

- When **either the parent or the child writes** to a shared page:
    
    - A **soft page fault** occurs.
        
    - The OS **copies the page** and gives the writing process **its own private copy**.
        
    - This breaks the sharing for that page.
        

So eventually, they **each have their own memory**, at least for pages that were written to.

---

### üîç Summary

|Time|Memory Sharing|
|---|---|
|Immediately after `fork()`|‚úÖ Yes (shared, read-only, via COW)|
|After either process writes|‚ùå No (private copy is made)|
|Read-only access only|‚úÖ Still shared|

---

Let me know if you want a demo in C to see this behavior in practice!

##### You said:

so then they will have their own memory?

###### ChatGPT said:

‚úÖ **Yes ‚Äî eventually, the parent and child will have their own separate memory.**

Let‚Äôs break it down clearly:

---

### üîÑ **Immediately after `fork()`**

- The parent and child **share the same physical memory pages** using **Copy-On-Write (COW)**.
    
- But they already have **separate virtual memory spaces** ‚Äî different page tables.
    

---

### üñäÔ∏è **When either process writes to memory**

- The OS intercepts the write (because the shared page is marked read-only).
    
- Then it:
    
    1. Allocates a **new physical page**.
        
    2. Copies the contents of the original shared page.
        
    3. Updates the writing process‚Äôs page table to point to this new page.
        
    4. Makes it **writable**.
        

Now the two processes **no longer share that page** ‚Äî each has its **own private copy**.

---

### üìå Final Result

- The parent and child **start with shared pages**.
    
- As they modify memory, the OS **splits the shared pages**.
    
- In the end, they may have **completely separate memory** (especially if they modify a lot).

### üß† Think of it like:

> "They start with shared books (read-only), but if either writes in one, the OS gives them their own personal copy of that book."
